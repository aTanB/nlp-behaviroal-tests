# CheckList natural langauge capabilities of NLP models
Evaluating different NLP models using CheckList - a task agnostic methodology for testing linguistic capabilities by applying different behaviroal testing principles 

The current evaluation paradigm is based on evaluating models on a set which is often drawn from the same distribution as the training set. Such a paradigm favours low-bias models with little regard to the model's ability to generalize to cases from a different distribution.
